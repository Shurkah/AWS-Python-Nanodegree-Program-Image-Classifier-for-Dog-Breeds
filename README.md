# AWS-Python-Nanodegree-Program-Image-Classifier-for-Dog-Breeds

This is a project from my Udacity profile.
In the course, we were supplied with a pre-trained dog breed classificator and then had to supplement it with our own functions according to specifications.

More specifically, I needed to code the following functions: 
- time the code processing time
- create pet image labels based on the .jpeg file names
- create image classificator labels by running the classificator
- compare the pet image label and the classificator label
- add classifying labels as Dogs and Non-Dogs
- calculate results
- calculate precision stats for three different architectures
- printing results

I also had to 
- compare the three different architectures to define which is the best
- upload my own dog- and non-dog-images and run the classifier on them
- compare the performance of the three architectures on my own data
